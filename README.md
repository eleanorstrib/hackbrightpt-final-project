This is my first commit!  Here's what it has and what's working:
- Bootstrap, bootstrap validator and less all implemented
- The framework: Header and footer working with icons and mouseover behavior (not linked to other pages)
- Zip code search box with validation working

Still to do:
- On this page:
   - Styling
   - API call to TV media
   - Display of results
- Other pages 
   - MVP: ideas form (to email), info page
   - Ideal: YT and Twitter pages with API calls and page to send texts (chat)
